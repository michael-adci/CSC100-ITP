In a grade calculator, checking from highest to lowest score is important when you're assigning letter grades or grade bands (like A, B, C, etc.) based on thresholds. Here's why:

✅ Priority of Higher Grades
If you check from lowest to highest, a student who qualifies for an A might be incorrectly assigned a B or C, because the first condition they meet (e.g., "score ≥ 50") will be applied—even though they also meet the higher thresholds.

Example:
Suppose your grading logic is:




Python
if score >= 50:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 65:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "A"
If a student scores 85, the program will assign a C, because score >= 50 is true, and it never checks the higher thresholds.

✅ Correct Order (Highest to Lowest):



Python
if score >= 80:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 65:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 50:
    grade = "C"
Now, a score of 85 correctly gets an A, because the highest condition is checked first.
